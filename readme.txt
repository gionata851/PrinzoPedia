My name is Gionata Prinzo, engineer and student at Eduonix.
This is the project of the first section of the Javascript e-degree. With it I simply tried to use the dictionary idea shown by professor Gray Lewis and to go further, showing the most amount of information I could. This means that the app will publish all the words, all the meanings and definitions given by the api, showing as well examples, phonetics and synonyms if provided.
As you may see, you can choose the language as well. I focused on languages I know, more or less, mostly for debugging purposes.
Fortunately I already know HTML and CSS so wasn't a problem for me to structure and visually organize the data.

I debugged a lot and it seems working fine. I admit I'm proud of it! I hope you appreciate as well.

Regards,

Gionata Prinzo
